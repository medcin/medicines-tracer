# medicines-tracker
this project will let you track your medicines 


in this [tag](https://github.com/medcin/medicines-tracer/commit/229ea35ceb8643c4e4a38b293e45d87aa1c6751d)  I have used hbs 


I chose to use Handlebars because it was difficult to copy and paste headers and footers into every HTML file I had. Making any changes would require modifying each file, which was time-consuming and error-prone. I searched for a solution for almost a month, but couldn't find one that worked well.

I haven't committed any of my attempts, as they were poorly executed and I ended up deleting them. However, after learning about Handlebars, I was thrilled to discover that it's an implementation of the MVC design pattern. This made me even more excited to use it.

With some rearrangement, I can make the Handlebars implementation even better. Using Handlebars allows HTML to inherit from a parent HTML file, making it easier to maintain.
